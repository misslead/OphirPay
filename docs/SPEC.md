# OphirPay — Contract Specification & Invariants

## Overview

This document defines the formal invariants that the OphirPay Soroban contract
MUST maintain across all operations. These invariants serve as the foundation
for testing, auditing, and formal verification. The Kani harnesses in
[contracts/ophirpay/spec/src/invariants.rs](../contracts/ophirpay/spec/src/invariants.rs)
check hand-written models of these invariants, not the deployed contract — see the
trust/claim finding in [AUDIT.md](./AUDIT.md).

---

## Core Invariants

### INV-1: No Reinitialization

**Statement:** The contract SHALL be initialized exactly once. Calling `init()`
after the first successful initialization MUST return `AlreadyInitialized`.

**Code evidence:** `init()` checks `env.storage().instance().has(&OWNER)` before
setting state. The `OWNER` key acts as a sentinel — its presence means the
contract is already initialized.

**Test:** `test_init_twice_fails` — verifies second `init()` call returns error.

---

### INV-2: Two-Step Ownership Transfer with Timelock

**Statement:** The contract owner CANNOT be changed without:
1. The current owner proposing a new owner (`transfer_ownership`)
2. A 24-hour timelock elapsing (86,400 ledger seconds)
3. The proposed new owner accepting (`accept_ownership`)

A pending transfer can be cancelled by the current owner at any time before
acceptance. After acceptance, the old owner has zero authority.

**Code evidence:**
- `transfer_ownership()` sets `PENDING_OWNER` and `OWNER_PROPOSED_AT` (timestamp)
- `accept_ownership()` checks `caller == pending_owner` AND
  `now - proposed_at >= 86400`
- `cancel_ownership_transfer()` clears both keys (current owner only)

**Test:** `test_two_step_ownership` — verifies:
- Non-owner cannot propose
- New owner cannot accept before 24h
- New owner can accept after 24h
- Old owner loses access after transfer

---

### INV-3: Locked-Funds Protection (emergency_withdraw)

**Statement:** The `emergency_withdraw()` function MUST NOT allow the owner to
withdraw tokens that are locked in active escrows or streams. The invariant is:

```
withdraw_amount <= token_balance - locked_balance
```

where `locked_balance` is the sum of all funds deposited via `create_escrow`
and `create_stream`, minus funds released via `release_escrow`, `claim_escrow`,
`claim_stream`, and `cancel_stream`.

**Code evidence:**
- `add_locked(env, amount)` is called after each `token_client.transfer()` that
  deposits funds into the contract (escrow creation, stream creation)
- `add_locked(env, -amount)` is called before each `token_client.transfer()`
  that withdraws funds (escrow release/claim, stream claim/cancel)
- `emergency_withdraw()` reads `LOCKED_BALANCE` and compares:
  `if amount > unlocked { return Err(NoTokensToWithdraw); }`

**Test:** `test_emergency_withdraw_locked_funds` — verifies:
- Owner CAN withdraw accidentally-sent (unlocked) funds
- Owner CANNOT withdraw funds locked in an active escrow
- After escrow released, locked balance decreases accordingly

---

### INV-4: Escrow Single-Release

**Statement:** An escrow's funds SHALL be released at most once. After
`released = true`, any subsequent call to `release_escrow()`, `claim_escrow()`,
or `arbiter_release_escrow()` MUST return an error (`EscrowAlreadyReleased` or
`EscrowAlreadyReleased`).

**Code evidence:**
- `release_escrow()`: checks `escrow.released` before transferring
- `claim_escrow()`: checks `escrow.released` before transferring
- `arbiter_release_escrow()`: checks `escrow.released` before transferring
- Each sets `escrow.released = true` after the token transfer

**Test:** `test_escrow_single_release` and `test_escrow_cannot_double_claim`

---

### INV-5: Stream Claim ≤ Vested Amount

**Statement:** A stream recipient SHALL never claim more than the linearly
vested amount at any given time. The claimable amount is:

```
claimable = min(total_amount, (now - start) / (end - start) * total_amount) - claimed_amount
```

After the stream end time, the full remaining amount is claimable.

**Code evidence:** `compute_vested()` evaluates `total_amount * elapsed` at
256-bit precision: `i128::checked_mul` on the fast path, and the quotient/
remainder decomposition `(a / d) * b + ((a % d) * b) / d` when the 128-bit
product would overflow. The result is therefore always the exact linear vesting
value and is bounded by `total_amount`.

Overflow MUST NOT collapse the vested amount to `0` (which silently under-vests
a large stream) and MUST NOT cap it at `total_amount` (which would over-vest a
stream that is only partially elapsed).

`claim_stream()` computes `claimable = vested.checked_sub(stream.claimed_amount)`,
returning `StreamInvariantViolated` (307) if the subtraction would be negative
and `StreamFullyClaimed` if `claimable == 0`.

**Test:** `test_create_and_claim_stream` — verifies partial claims at 50% and
that the full amount is claimable after end time. Overflow behaviour is covered
by `test_compute_vested_overflow_is_exact_and_not_zero`,
`test_compute_vested_overflow_is_bounded_and_monotonic`,
`test_compute_vested_overflow_fully_vests_at_end`,
`test_claim_stream_with_overflowing_vesting_pays_correct_balance` and the
end-to-end `test_stream_vesting_overflow_pays_correct_balance_end_to_end`.

---

### INV-6: Multisig Threshold Enforcement

**Statement:** A multisig payment proposal SHALL NOT be executed unless the
number of unique approvals meets or exceeds the configured threshold.
Duplicate approvals from the same signer MUST be rejected.

**Code evidence:**
- `approve_payment()` checks `request.approvals.iter().any(|a| a == signer)`
  for duplicates, returning `AlreadyApproved`
- `execute_approved_payment()` checks `request.approvals.len() >= config.threshold`,
  returning `ThresholdNotMet`

**Test:** `test_multisig_threshold_enforcement` — verifies:
- Below threshold → `ThresholdNotMet`
- At threshold → executes successfully
- Duplicate approval → `AlreadyApproved`

---

### INV-7: Pause Blocks Mutations (Global Override + Scopes)

**Statement:** When the contract is globally paused (`PAUSED = true`), all
state-mutating functions MUST return `ContractPaused`; read-only functions
(getters) SHALL continue to work. Independently, a single feature scope can be
paused so only that subsystem's mutating entrypoints return `ContractPaused`.
The global pause always overrides the scope flags, so a scope can never
re-enable a write while the contract is globally paused.

**Scopes:** `PauseScope` enumerates eight feature domains exposed by numeric id:
`Payments = 0`, `Escrows = 1`, `Streams = 2`, `Recurring = 3`, `Refunds = 4`,
`Governance = 5`, `Hooks = 6`, `Batches = 7`.

**Code evidence:**
- `require_not_paused(env, scope)` starts every write function. It returns
  `ContractPaused` when the global `PAUSED` flag is set **or** when that
  operation's scope is paused; the global check runs first, so it overrides.
- `set_scope_paused(caller, scope, paused)` is owner-only, stores one instance
  flag per scope and records a `scope_paused` / `scope_resumed` audit entry.
  Unknown scope ids are rejected with `InvalidPauseScope`.
- `is_scope_paused(scope)` and `get_paused_scopes()` expose the scope flags to
  the read API without a signature.
- `emergency_pause_all` / `emergency_unpause_all` keep their atomic
  cross-contract propagation to the Emitter and only toggle the global flag, so
  scope flags are preserved across an emergency unpause.

**Test:**
- `test_pause_blocks_record_payment`, `test_pause_blocks_create_escrow` and
  `test_pause_blocks_create_stream` — a global pause rejects writes while
  getters keep returning data.
- `test_paused_contract_blocks_payments` (integration) — a globally paused
  contract rejects `record_payment` and accepts it again after unpause.
- `test_scoped_pause_blocks_only_that_scope` (integration) — pausing `Payments`
  blocks `record_payment` while escrows and getters keep working, and resuming
  the scope restores payments.
- `test_global_pause_overrides_scopes` (integration) — with no scope flag set,
  `emergency_pause_all` blocks both payments and escrows while getters still
  answer.
- `test_unknown_pause_scope_is_rejected` (integration) — `set_scope_paused(8, …)`
  and `is_scope_paused(8)` return `InvalidPauseScope`.

### INV-8: Payment Immutability (After Recording)

**Statement:** Once a payment is recorded, its core fields (payer, payee,
amount, asset, tx_hash) SHALL NOT be modified. The only allowed mutation is
`cancelled: false → true` via `cancel_payment()`.

**Code evidence:** Payments are stored as persistent entries keyed by ID.
There is no `update_payment()` function. `cancel_payment()` sets
`payment.cancelled = true` and returns `PaymentAlreadyCancelled` if already
cancelled.

**Test:** `test_cancel_payment_idempotent`

---

### INV-9: Fee Calculation is Pure (Zero Side Effects)

**Statement:** `calculate_fee()` SHALL be a pure function — it reads no
storage, writes no storage, and emits no events. Calling it with the same
arguments always returns the same result.

**Code evidence:** `calculate_fee(amount: i128, fee_bps: u32) -> i128` has
no `env` parameter and contains only arithmetic operations.

**Test:** `test_calculate_fee_pure` — verifies same inputs produce same output
and no state is modified.

---

### INV-10: Version History is Append-Only (Capped at 100)

**Statement:** Fee configuration and multisig configuration version histories
SHALL grow monotonically (never shrink or be deleted) and SHALL be capped at
100 entries in query results to prevent unbounded gas consumption.

**Code evidence:**
- `set_fee_config()` creates a new `FeeConfigVersion` with `ver_count += 1`
- `set_multisig_config()` creates a new `MultisigVersion` similarly
- `get_fee_config_history()` and `get_multisig_config_history()` compute
  `start = if total > 100 { total - 99 } else { 1 }` and return at most 100

**Test:** `test_version_history_capped` — verifies that after 150 config
changes, only the latest 100 are returned.

---

### INV-11: Enumeration is Bounded and Reports Truncation

**Statement:** Every read-only function that enumerates a stored collection
SHALL return at most `MAX_READER_ENTRIES` (100) entries and SHALL expose
whether the result was truncated. A reader MUST NOT walk an arbitrarily long
stored vector inside a single invocation.

The bounded readers are:

| Reader | Result type | Cap | Order | Truncation field |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `get_audit_log_range(start_id, end_id)` | `Vec<AuditEntry>` | 100 | most recent first | *(inherent in the requested range)* |
| `get_payments_range(start_id, end_id)` | `Vec<Payment>` | 100 | most recent first | *(inherent in the requested range)* |
| `get_reason_code_analytics()` | `Vec<(u32, u64)>` | 100 most recent refunds | n/a | *(aggregate)* |
| `get_fee_config_history()` / `get_multisig_config_history()` | `Vec<…Version>` | 100 | most recent first | *(inherent in the requested range)* |
| `get_payments_by_batch(batch_id)` | `PaymentList` | 100 | most recent first | `truncated` |
| `get_subscriber_hooks(subscriber)` | `HookList` | 100 | most recent first | `truncated` |

`PaymentList` and `HookList` carry `items`, `total` (how many entries the
underlying collection actually holds) and `truncated` (true only when the
reader stopped before exhausting the collection). Callers MUST treat
`truncated == true` as partial data: page, or ask for a narrower query.

The upstream collections are **not** self-bounding. `register_hook` places no
limit on how many hooks a subscriber accumulates, and a batch record written
before the `BatchTooLarge` guard existed can hold more payment ids than
`create_batch` accepts today. The cap therefore lives in the reader, not in the
writer's current validation.

**Rationale:** docs/AUDIT.md MEDIUM-2 — unbounded enumeration makes an
endpoint unreliable (instruction-budget exhaustion) rather than returning a
clean error.

**Tests:** `test_get_subscriber_hooks_caps_and_flags_truncation`,
`test_get_subscriber_hooks_at_cap_is_not_truncated`,
`test_get_payments_by_batch_caps_and_flags_truncation`,
`test_get_payments_by_batch_within_cap_is_not_truncated`

## Testing Strategy

Each invariant is verified by unit tests, property-based proptests, and integration harnesses:
- **Unit Tests**: `contracts/ophirpay/src/lib.rs` (lines ~3840+)
- **Proptest Suite**: `contracts/ophirpay/tests/proptest_token_moving.rs` (fuzzing token paths, reentrancy-shaped sequences, and `LOCKED_BALANCE` conservation)
- **Integration Tests**: `contracts/ophirpay/tests/integration/` (end-to-end multi-contract flows)

To run tests:
```bash
cd contracts/ophirpay && cargo test                             # unit tests & in-crate property tests
cd contracts/ophirpay && cargo test --test proptest_token_moving # dedicated proptest suite
cd contracts/emitter && cargo test                              # emitter unit tests
```

## Future Verification Work

- [x] Property testing with `proptest` for token-moving paths & reentrancy sequences (`LOCKED_BALANCE` conservation)
- [ ] Bounded model checking with `kani` for the 5 highest-risk invariants.
      The harnesses in [contracts/ophirpay/spec/src/invariants.rs](../contracts/ophirpay/spec/src/invariants.rs)
      model the invariants by hand, share no code with the contract, and are not run in CI —
      see the trust/claim finding in [AUDIT.md](./AUDIT.md).
- [ ] Formal verification of the `compute_vested()` function (overflow safety).
      The boundary branches are modelled in `contracts/ophirpay/spec/src/invariants.rs`,
      but the widened multiply path is not yet machine-checked — see the Kani
      findings in [AUDIT.md](./AUDIT.md).
- [ ] Third-party security audit before mainnet deployment
