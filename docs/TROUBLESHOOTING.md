## 🔧 Setup & environment

### 1. Freighter not detected

**Symptom**: The wallet button does nothing, or you see an "install Freighter" prompt even though you have the extension installed.

**Cause**: The Freighter extension is not installed, is not unlocked, or the page was loaded before the extension injected its API into the page.

**Resolution**:
1. Install Freighter from the [official extension store](https://freighter.app) (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
2. Unlock it with your password and make sure you have a funded account selected.
3. Refresh the page — the wallet API is injected at page load, so a reload is required after installing/unlocking.
4. If it still fails, open the browser console and look for an `isConnected` error, then retry.

### 2. Rust wasm32 target missing

**Symptom**: `cargo build` fails for the contracts with an error like `target may not be installed` / `no such file or directory ... wasm32v1-none`, or the WASM reproducibility check in CI cannot compile the contract.

**Cause**: The contract targets `wasm32v1-none`, but that Rust target is not installed on your toolchain.

**Resolution**: Install the target with rustup, then rebuild:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release
```

### 3. Prisma migration errors

**Symptom**: `next build` or `npm run dev` fails at the Prisma step — e.g. `P1001`/`P1000` connection errors, `table does not exist`, or `Schema not found`.

**Cause**: The database is unreachable (`DATABASE_URL` unset/wrong), the client is out of sync with `prisma/schema.prisma`, or pending migrations were never applied.

**Resolution**:
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in `.env.local` (and `DATABASE_PROVIDER` is `postgresql` for production, `sqlite` for local dev).
2. Apply the schema to your database: `npx prisma db push`.
3. Regenerate the client: `npx prisma generate`.
4. Re-run the build. If migrations exist, prefer `npx prisma migrate deploy` over `db push` in production.

### 4. WASM build failures

**Symptom**: Contract build fails during `npm run build` or the contracts CI job — e.g. `linker 'wasm-ld' not found` or `error: failed to load bitcode`.

**Cause**: The `wasm32v1-none` target or the wasm linker is missing, or the build was invoked without the `--release` profile that the contracts require.

**Resolution**:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release
```

If `wasm-ld` is missing, install a wasm-capable LLD via your package manager or rustup component, then retry.

### 5. Node version mismatch

**Symptom**: `npm install` or `npm run dev` fails with engine errors, or the app behaves differently than CI (which passes).

**Cause**: Your local Node version differs from the pinned version in `.nvmrc` / `.node-version` / `package.json` `engines`.

**Resolution**: Switch to the pinned version:

```bash
nvm use          # reads .nvmrc
node -v          # confirm it matches the engines field in package.json
npm ci
```

### 6. Port conflicts

**Symptom**: Starting the dev server or the WebSocket event server fails with `EADDRINUSE`, or `npm run dev` prints `Port 3000 is in use`.

**Cause**: Another process is already listening on the default port (3000 for Next.js, 8787 for the event WebSocket server).

**Resolution**:
1. Find the offender: `lsof -i :3000` (macOS/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :3000` (Windows), then kill it.
2. Or run on a different port: `npm run dev -- -p 3001`.
3. For the events server, set `EVENTS_WS_PORT` (default `8787`) to a free port.

### `npm install` fails or hangs

**Symptom**: `npm install` errors out, or the install never finishes.

**Cause**: Lockfile out of sync, registry/network issue, or a platform-specific dependency.

**Resolution**:
1. Delete `node_modules` and re-run `npm ci` (uses the committed lockfile): `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci`.
2. If you changed dependencies, run `npm install` and **commit the updated `package-lock.json`**.
3. Check `npm config get registry` is a reachable registry (default `https://registry.npmjs.org/`).

### `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.env'` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values missing

**Symptom**: App starts but env-driven features are blank or error at runtime.

**Cause**: No `.env.local` / `.env.production` file.

**Resolution**: `cp .env.example .env.local` and fill in the required values (see the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md#environment-variables)). Restart the dev server — Next.js caches env at boot.

### `AUTH_SECRET is not set` at login

**Symptom**: Login/session endpoints fail with an auth error.

**Cause**: Missing session-signing secret.

**Resolution**: Generate one and set it: `echo "AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env.local`. Restart.

### `next build` fails after switching branches

**Symptom**: Build errors referencing stale code or missing modules.

**Cause**: Stale `.next` cache or leftover `node_modules` from another branch.

**Resolution**: `rm -rf .next node_modules && npm ci && npm run build`.

## 💰 Funding (friendbot)

### Friendbot returns an error or the account stays at 0 XLM

**Symptom**: `friendbot.stellar.org` request fails, or the account balance stays 0 after funding.

**Cause**: You requested funds for the **wrong network** (friendbot only funds **testnet**), the address is malformed, or the account already has funds (friendbot refuses duplicates).

**Resolution**:
1. Only use friendbot on **testnet**: `curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=<PUBLIC_KEY>"`.
2. Verify the address is a valid Stellar `G…` strkey (56 chars).
3. Check the balance via Horizon: `curl -s "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/accounts/<PUBLIC_KEY>" | jq '.balances[] | select(.asset_type=="native") | .balance'`.
4. If it says the account already exists, it is funded — just poll Horizon until the balance appears.

### `Insufficient funds` on testnet

**Symptom**: Any transaction fails with `Insufficient funds` / `op_underfunded`.

**Cause**: The signing account has no XLM; on **testnet** it wasn't friendbot-funded.

**Resolution**: Fund it (friendbot for testnet, exchange for mainnet — **there is no friendbot on mainnet**), then wait a few seconds for the ledger to confirm before retrying.

### `Insufficient funds` on mainnet

**Symptom**: Deployment or payment fails with insufficient funds.

**Cause**: Mainnet accounts must be funded with **real XLM**; there is no friendbot.

**Resolution**: Send XLM from an exchange or funded wallet to the account, confirm the balance via `https://horizon.stellar.org/accounts/<PUBLIC_KEY>`, and budget ≥ 100 XLM for contract deployment (see the [Mainnet Runbook](MAINNET_RUNBOOK.md#01-funding)).

## 🌐 RPC & network

### `failed to send HTTP request` / RPC timeout

**Symptom**: API routes or the CLI hang, then fail with a request/connection error.

**Cause**: Soroban RPC endpoint unreachable, wrong URL, or a firewall/proxy issue.

**Resolution**:
1. Verify the endpoint responds: `curl -s -X POST https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth"}'`.
2. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_RPC_URL` (testnet: `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443`, mainnet: `https://soroban.stellar.org:443`).
3. Check [status.stellar.org](https://status.stellar.org) for an outage.
4. Retry — transient timeouts are normal; the app retries automatically.

### `Horizon timeout` / Horizon requests fail

**Symptom**: Account/balance lookups fail; the dashboard shows no balances.

**Cause**: Horizon endpoint down, slow, or misconfigured.

**Resolution**:
1. Verify: `curl -s https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/ | jq .core_version`.
2. Confirm `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_HORIZON_URL` matches the network.
3. Check status.stellar.org.
4. Try the alternate Horizon instance for your network.

### `Network passphrase mismatch`

**Symptom**: Transaction submission fails with a passphrase error.

**Cause**: `STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` doesn't match the configured network.

**Resolution**: Testnet: `Test SDF Network ; September 2015`. Mainnet: `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015`. They must match `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` (`TESTNET`/`PUBLIC`) — see the [env table](DEPLOYMENT.md#testnet-vs-mainnet).

### `Contract not found` / contract calls return empty

**Symptom**: API routes that read the contract return nothing, or `Contract not found`.

**Cause**: Wrong `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMITTER_CONTRACT_ID`, or the contract lives on a different network.

**Resolution**:
1. Verify the IDs in `.env.local` against the [contract registry](deployment-mainnet.md#26-contract-address-registry) (testnet IDs are pre-configured in `.env.example`).
2. Confirm the contract was deployed on the same network you're pointing at.

## 🤝 Trustlines

### Non-native asset (e.g. USDC) can't be selected or sent

**Symptom**: The asset is greyed out, or sending fails with a trustline error.

**Cause**: The destination/your account has no **trustline** for that asset+issuer. OphirPay checks this via `checkTrustline` before selecting an asset.

**Resolution**:
1. Add a trustline for the asset in Freighter (Assets → Add asset, enter code + issuer).
2. Confirm it registered: check the account balances on Horizon and look for the asset's `asset_code`/`asset_issuer`.
3. Retry the payment.

### `would exceed trustline limit` / payment over trustline cap

**Symptom**: Sending an amount fails at the trustline limit.

**Cause**: The receiving account's trustline limit is lower than the send amount.

**Resolution**: Have the recipient raise the trustline limit (Freighter lets you edit the limit), or reduce the amount.

---

## 👛 Wallet rejections

### Freighter doesn't connect / "Freighter not found"

**Symptom**: Wallet button does nothing, or "install Freighter" prompt.

**Cause**: Freighter extension not installed, or not unlocked.

**Resolution**:
1. Install Freighter from the [extension store](https://freighter.app).
2. Unlock it.
3. Refresh the page.
4. If it still fails, check the browser console for an `isConnected` error and retry.

### Wallet says "wrong network"

**Symptom**: Transaction rejected with a network error.

**Cause**: Freighter is on a different network than the app (`TESTNET` vs `PUBLIC`).

**Resolution**: Switch Freighter's network to match the app (`Testnet` for local/testnet, `Mainnet` for production) and retry.

### Wallet shows "transaction rejected"

**Symptom**: The wallet popup opens but the transaction is rejected.

**Cause**: The user clicked "Reject", or the wallet auto-rejected (e.g. fee too high, or the account is a hardware wallet requiring confirmation).

**Resolution**:
1. Retry and **approve** the transaction in the popup.
2. Check the fee estimate isn't above the wallet's threshold.
3. For hardware wallets, confirm the transaction on the device.

### Transaction fails after approval (in `submitted` / `failed` state)

**Symptom**: The wallet signs, but the payment errors on submission.

**Cause**: Common causes: insufficient funds, invalid destination, missing memo for memo-required destination, or expired timebounds.

**Resolution**:
1. Confirm the payer has XLM to cover the amount + fee.
2. Confirm the destination `G…`/`C…` address is valid.
3. If the destination requires a memo, include one.
4. Retry — the app rebuilds the transaction.

## ⚙️ App runtime

### `Rate limit exceeded` (HTTP 429)

**Symptom**: API requests fail with 429.

**Cause**: Per-IP rate limit hit (`RATE_LIMIT_RPM`, default 120/min).

**Resolution**: Wait for the window to reset. For sustained load, raise `RATE_LIMIT_RPM` or configure `REDIS_URL` for distributed limiting.

### `CSRF_INVALID`

**Symptom**: Form/API submissions fail with a CSRF error.

**Cause**: Stale session cookie or `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` mismatch.

**Resolution**: Clear cookies and reload. Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` matches the origin you're using (localhost vs. domain).

### Payments page is empty after sending a payment

**Symptom**: The payment succeeded on-chain but doesn't appear in the UI.

**Cause**: The page reads from the contract via RPC; a stale RPC response or wrong contract ID.

**Resolution**:
1. Verify on-chain: `stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- get_payment_count`.
2. Check the [contract registry](deployment-mainnet.md#26-contract-address-registry) for the right ID.
3. Refresh after a few seconds (the chain confirms asynchronously).

---

## 📡 Live events (SSE)

### Live feed shows "offline" / events stop arriving

**Symptom**: The `/events` page status flips to offline, or `payment:created` events stop.

**Cause**: The SSE route (`GET /api/events`) is unreachable — often a reverse proxy that buffers the stream, or the emitter contract/RPC is down.

**Resolution**:
1. Verify the stream: `curl -N http://localhost:3000/api/events` — you should see a `connected` event then `heartbeat` frames every 15 s.
2. If behind Nginx, disable buffering (`proxy_buffering off;`) — see the [Nginx example](DEPLOYMENT.md#reverse-proxy-nginx).
3. Check the emitter contract ID and RPC health (see [RPC & network](#-rpc--network)).

### `WebSocket connection failed` then falls back

**Symptom**: Status shows `fallback` (SSE) instead of WS.

**Cause**: The WebSocket event server (port `8787`, `EVENTS_WS_PORT`) isn't running or isn't reachable; the client falls back to SSE automatically.

**Resolution**:
1. This is **expected behavior** — SSE fallback works.
2. The WebSocket server starts automatically on boot via `instrumentation.ts` (`EVENTS_WS_PORT`, default `8787`); check the startup log for `WebSocket event server listening`.
3. Confirm `ws(s)://<host>:8787/api/events` connects.
4. In production, make sure the port is exposed through the ingress/load balancer.

## Quick checks

- `node -v` matches `.nvmrc` / `package.json` engines.
- `.env.local` exists and all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` + `DATABASE_URL`/`AUTH_SECRET` values are set.
- `npx prisma db push && npx prisma generate` succeeded.
- `cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release` succeeds for the contracts.
- `curl -s https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/ | jq .core_version` responds.
- Freighter is installed, unlocked, and on the same network as the app.

## Still stuck?

- Check [status.stellar.org](https://status.stellar.org) for network-wide issues.
- Search [docs/AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md), [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md), and the [Mainnet Runbook](MAINNET_RUNBOOK.md).
- Open an issue with: the **exact error message**, your **network** (`TESTNET`/`PUBLIC`), the **commands you ran**, and whether it reproduces locally.
